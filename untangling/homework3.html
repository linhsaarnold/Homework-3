                $1000/Month Web Marketing Plan <br/>
                <br/>
                Keywords<br/>
                Since I am untable to use "star wars toys" as key words, I plan to choose words that are similar in order to reach a similar audience. <br/>
                "Space Wars Toys" <br/>
                "Space Wars Figurines" <br/>
                "Star Battle Toys <br/>
                "Star Battle Figurines" <br/>
                <br/>
                The Rest of the Money? <br/>
                - I would spend money in the form of prodyct by giving the toys away to popular online personalities that fit the target market. In exchange, the people I partner with would talk about the toys on their various platforms (blogs, youtube, etc...) <br/>
                - I would make sure to hire a good team for maintaining the website, as well as a web designer to creat an aesthetically pleasing website and online store <br/>
                - Ideally, I would hire a martketing team to help with SEO Strategies <br/>
